Flixplore
=========

Flixplore displays first 110 photos from daily Flickr Explores using Meteor (http://meteor.com)

This project is developed as a demonstration of Meteor API. I have added a custom package "jquery-colorbox" which 
you can find in the packages folder. To install this package in your local installation of Meteor, just copy "jquery-colorbox" folder
and paste the folder in "/usr/local/meteor/packages" directory. 

Running Flixplore in your local environment

1. Install Meteor

In terminal, 
meteor create flixploretest
cd flixplorertest
meteor add jquery
meteor add http
meteor add jquery-colorbox

now paste all the contents of flixplore directory in your "flixploretest" directory. 

7. meteor 

Now point your browser to http://localhost:3000 . Thats it. For anything, feel free to drop me a line at hasin@leevio.com
